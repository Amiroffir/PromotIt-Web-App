# PromotIt
"PromotIt" handles the social promotion of the non-profit organization and other related campaigns. <br/>
The system's goal is to promote social campaigns. <br/>
The first version of the System – The Minimal Viable Product (MVP), is limited but can be extended in the future. 
The system's goal is to promote social campaigns. The means to do so involve onboarding business organizations that donate products, onboarding non-profit organizations that want to promote campaigns, and onboarding social activists – users of Twitter that can promote those campaigns.
